<h1>About me</h1>
  <p> Hi, everyone. I'm <a href="https://github.com/k-e034">k-e034</a>, a font creator. I'm a student at a university in Tokyo, Japan. 
This text you're now reading is formatted with "Good Day Sans" which is my first original font. I am providing several digital font files on the Internet as "E-Type Design".</p>
<h2>What's E-Type Design?</h2>
<p class="ltn-ja"> E-Type Design is a font vendor (or provider) which I am running. "E" at the beginning of the name stands for several meanings. In spoken Japanese language,
  which is my mother tongue, a word "良い" (litterally means "good") is pronounced <i>"ee"</i> just like pronouncing "E" in English. Also, the initial letter for my family name is "E",
  so I put the letter at the beginning of this font vendor/provider name.</p>
